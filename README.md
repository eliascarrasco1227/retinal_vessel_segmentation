# retinal_vessel_segmentation
This is a repository with a google colab notebook that solves the retinal vessel segmentation using advanced computer vision techniques in python. 

## Inputes and outputs of the program
Input Image: This is one of the raw eye fundus image extracted from the DRIVE dataset, containing complex features such as blood vessels, noise, and reflections.

## Steps
This section outlines the sequential steps applied to achieve precise segmentation of blood vessels in ocular images. To read more about the methodology you can read the file in paper where the methodology reflects careful consideration of available alternatives, with each decision based on rigorous evaluation of performance and accuracy. The final implementation achieves remarkable results by maximizing vessel visibility and suppressing noise or irrelevant features.

## Introduction
The segmentation of retinal blood vessels plays a crucial role in the early detection of various eye-related diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and hypertension. This project focuses on developing a non-deep-learning approach to accurately segment blood vessels from eye fundus images extracted from the DRIVE dataset. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, we designed a robust pipeline that employs preprocessing, noise reduction, adaptive thresholding, and morphological operations to extract vascular structures. The proposed method achieves a Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.5592 when compared to ground-truth data, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach. Achieving such a high level of segmentation accuracy without the use of machine learning highlights the strength of this carefully crafted algorithm.
