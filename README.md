# retinal_vessel_segmentation
This is a repository with a google colab notebook that solves the retinal vessel segmentation using advanced computer vision techniques in python. 

## Inputes and outputs of the program
The input of the program is a picture of a retinal blood vessels from eye:

![Input of the program, a retinal blood vessels from eye ](https://github.com/eliascarrasco1227/retinal_vessel_segmentation/blob/main/images/input_and_output/input.png)

Expected output:

![Input of the program, a retinal blood vessels from eye ](https://github.com/eliascarrasco1227/retinal_vessel_segmentation/blob/main/images/input_and_output/expected_output.png)

Real output: (with a similarity reached of 60%, wihtout using deep learning models):
